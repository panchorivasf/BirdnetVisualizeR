\title{Create a heatmap of bird vocal activity by month and hour}
\usage{
vocal_activity_heatmap(df, sp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing bird detection data. Must include a 'datetime' column
with POSIXct dates, and either 'Scientific.name' or 'Common.name' columns if filtering
by species.}

\item{sp}{Optional character string specifying the species to plot. Can be either the
scientific name or common name (must match values in the data). If NULL (default),
includes all species in the data.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the vocal activity heatmap. The x-axis shows hours
  of the day (0-23), the y-axis shows months, and tile color represents the count of
  vocalizations.
}
\description{
This function generates a heatmap visualization showing patterns of bird vocal activity
across different hours of the day and months of the year. The heatmap uses color intensity
to represent the frequency of detected vocalizations.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
  \item Filters data for the specified species (if provided)
  \item Aggregates detections by month and hour
  \item Creates a complete grid of all month-hour combinations
  \item Generates a heatmap using viridis color scale
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plot vocal activity for a specific species
vocal_activity_heatmap(df = BirdnetDetections, sp = "Anthus hodgsoni")

# Plot vocal activity for all species in the data
vocal_activity_heatmap(df = BirdnetDetections)
}
